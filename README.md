Automated Trading with python via Gemini API

thinking about the trading bot

my only concern is that the cloud service I'm using only executes the code every hour.

so even with the built in stop loss of 3%, if bitcoin has a knife drop candle (which is not unlikely) in between windows it could loose a lot more that 3%

so I'll have to find a hosting service that runs the code continuously or maybe every few minutes, without it being too expensive.

will start to build application pipeline with analytical ends 

constructing pipeline with microsoft azure
